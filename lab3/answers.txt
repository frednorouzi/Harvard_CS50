sort1 uses: Bubble Sort
How do you know?: because S1 in sorted data was significantly faster than S3 but in random and reverse data not. (sorted data is required for bubble search)

sort2 uses: Merge Sort
How do you know?: Because Merge Sort is much faster than other methods and S2 in most of random, reverse and sorted data had better performance than others.

sort3 uses: Selection Sort
How do you know?: Because Selection sort in both worst and best scenario should search n**2 and it could be considered as a slowest method.
