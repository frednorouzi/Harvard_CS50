                    </h3>

                    <p>
                    My name is Maryam Pakdel. I was born in Tehran, Iran. I completed my Bachelor degree of Science in plant pathology at Zanjan University.<br>
                    After completing my degree, I trained informal art  that was about charcoal, pastel and oil painting. I came to the U.S in 2011 and
                    got my associateâ€™s degree, majoring in studio art, at Folsom Lake College in Sacramento.</p><p> In 2020, I got my bachelor of Art Education at
                    California State University Sacramento.<br> The majority of my works are cultural paintings of Iran which has one of the richest art heritages
                    in world history.</p><p> However, I believe that getting away from my country, culture, and tradition helped me to understand more about other cultures
                    and traditions that will have a big influence in my works of art in the future.
